# Nearby Hospital, Clinics & PathLab Finder

This is a simple web project created to help people find nearby hospitals, clinics, and PathLabs. Itâ€™s built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and includes cards for different hospitals with their details.  

## Features
- Search and view nearby hospitals and clinics
- Cards displaying hospital info like name, location, and services
- Responsive and easy-to-use interface

I used:
- **HTML** for the structure of the pages
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and storing latitude & longitude.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Browse through the hospital cards.
3. Click on cards to see more info (it will redirect to info)

## What I Learned
- Organizing HTML, CSS, and JS files for a clean project structure
- Using cards to display structured information
- Making a simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface

## Future Improvements
- Integrate with real map APIs to show hospitals dynamically
- Add more filters (like specialties, ratings, etc.)
- Make it mobile-friendly with a better responsive design
